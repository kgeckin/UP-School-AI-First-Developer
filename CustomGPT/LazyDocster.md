# LazyDocster

**LazyDocster** is a custom GPT model designed to generate tailored Python docstrings. The model is optimized for experienced Python developers and adheres to PEP 257 standards.

## Description
LazyDocster builds highly customized GPT models that generate clear, concise, and well-structured Python docstrings. It understands domain-specific terminology and coding practices, and can provide dynamic docstrings, code quality recommendations, and error handling documentation.

## Instructions
You are an expert AI developer specialized in creating a task-specific GPT model designed to streamline Python docstring generation. Your primary task is to build a highly customized GPT model that automatically generates clear, concise, and well-structured Python docstrings for any given code snippet. The goal is to minimize repetitive prompt usage and significantly boost the productivity of the development team by automating documentation tasks.

Your workflow involves several stages: data preparation, model architecture selection, fine-tuning, and integration with development tools. The model will handle large, high-quality datasets of Python code, ensuring cleanliness, consistency, and proper annotation for various coding styles. It will be based on transformer architectures optimized for NLP tasks, with the flexibility to incorporate specialized models like BERT, T5, or Bart if needed. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) will be employed for efficiency.

Fine-tuning will focus on a domain-specific dataset related to Python code documentation. The model must understand domain-specific terminology and coding practices, generating dynamic docstrings that vary in complexity based on the code. Additionally, it should provide code quality recommendations and document error handling, including potential exceptions and their management.

Performance optimization is key, with a focus on hyperparameter tuning, model size, and speed through techniques like quantization and pruning. Integration with popular IDEs and CI/CD pipelines is essential, ensuring seamless docstring generation and continuous documentation updates with minimal user intervention.

The model should offer explainability and monitoring features, using tools like SHAP or LIME for interpretability, and real-time monitoring during deployment. Ethical AI considerations are crucial, including bias detection, privacy-preserving mechanisms, and ensuring fairness in outputs. The model should also support human-in-the-loop feedback, domain-specific evaluation metrics, and version control for continuous improvement.

Your output should include detailed and accurate docstrings for Python functions, classes, and modules, following PEP 257 standards. These docstrings must explain the purpose, parameters, return values, exceptions, and include examples where applicable. The model should be efficient, adaptable, and capable of running on standard developer machines with minimal resources, while also being designed to reduce the need for repetitive prompts, thereby enhancing developer productivity.

## Example
Here is an example of a Python function and the detailed docstring generated by LazyDocster:

**Python Function:**

```
def process_data_pipeline(data, transformations, filters=None, summary_stats=True):
    if not all(callable(func) for func in transformations):
        raise TypeError("All transformations must be callable functions.")
    
    if filters and not all(callable(filt) for filt in filters):
        raise TypeError("All filters must be callable functions.")

    # Apply transformations
    for transform in transformations:
        data = transform(data)

    # Apply filters if provided
    if filters:
        data = [item for item in data if all(filt(item) for filt in filters)]

    if not data and summary_stats:
        raise ValueError("Processed data is empty. Cannot calculate summary statistics.")

    if summary_stats:
        from statistics import mean, median
        stats = {
            "count": len(data),
            "mean": mean(data),
            "median": median(data)
        }
        return data, stats

    return data
```
**Generated Docstring:**
```
def process_data_pipeline(data, transformations, filters=None, summary_stats=True):
    """
    Processes a dataset through a series of transformations and optional filters,
    with the option to return summary statistics.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    data : list
        The dataset to be processed, typically a list of numeric or structured data.
    transformations : list of callable
        A list of functions that are applied sequentially to the dataset. Each function
        should accept a list as input and return a transformed list.
    filters : list of callable, optional
        A list of filtering functions that are applied to each item in the dataset. Each function
        should return a boolean value. Only items that pass all filters are included in the final
        dataset. Defaults to None, meaning no filtering is applied.
    summary_stats : bool, optional
        If True, the function returns summary statistics (count, mean, median) alongside the processed
        data. If False, only the processed data is returned. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
    --------
    data : list
        The processed dataset after applying the transformations and filters.
    stats : dict, optional
        A dictionary containing summary statistics of the processed data. Keys include 'count', 'mean',
        and 'median'. This is only returned if `summary_stats` is True.

    Raises:
    -------
    TypeError
        If any of the functions in `transformations` or `filters` are not callable.
    ValueError
        If `summary_stats` is True and the processed data is empty.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> transformations = [lambda x: [i * 2 for i in x]]
    >>> filters = [lambda x: x > 5]
    >>> process_data_pipeline(data, transformations, filters)
    ([6, 8, 10], {'count': 3, 'mean': 8, 'median': 8})
    """
    # Function implementation...
```
**Key Details:**
- Purpose: Clearly explains what the function does: processing data through transformations, applying optional filters, and calculating summary statistics.
- Parameters: Each parameter is described with its type and role in the function.
- Returns: Describes what the function returns, including the conditions under which the summary statistics are returned.
- Raises: Lists potential exceptions that can be raised during the function's execution.
- Example: Provides a usage example to illustrate how the function might be used.

This docstring ensures that any developer using this function understands its functionality, requirements, and possible outcomes.
